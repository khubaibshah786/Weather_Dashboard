# Description 


We have created a weather application that allows users to search for the current weather by searhing a city name and a 5-day forecast for any location. The main features include:

Search History: The application stores search history locally, allowing users to quickly access past search queries. The search history is displayed as buttons, making it easy for users to revisit previous searches.

Current Weather Display: Users can search for the current weather by entering a location. Upon submitting the search, the application retrieves and displays the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representing the weather condition.

5-Day Forecast: In addition to the current weather, users can view a 5-day forecast for the searched location. The forecast includes details such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather icons for each day.

Search History Management: Users can manage their search history by deleting individual entries. Clicking the "Delete" button next to a search history item removes it from the search history and localStorage.

Overall, the application provides a convenient way for users to check the current weather and forecast for any location, with the added functionality of storing and managing search history for quick access.
